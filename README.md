# Clothes Helper App

Clothes Helper is a cross‑platform Flutter application that helps users organise their wardrobe.  
Users can add new clothing items, mark them as in the wash or available, filter and edit existing items, and access VIP features like outfit suggestions and ad removal.

## Features

- **Wardrobe Management** – Add, edit and remove clothing items with attributes like name, type, colour, image, washing state and availability.
- **Local Persistence** – Clothes are stored locally using [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive), a lightweight NoSQL database designed for Flutter.
- **Ad‑Supported & VIP Modes** – The free tier displays Google AdMob banner and interstitial ads.  VIP users unlock advanced features and remove ads via an in‑app purchase (to be added in later phases).
- **AI Outfit Suggestions** – A premium feature which will suggest outfits based on simple heuristics such as colour matching and seasonal rules (planned for a future phase).
- **Optional Cloud Sync** – Future updates may include Firebase Authentication and Firestore synchronisation so users can back up their wardrobe and share across devices.

## Getting Started

This repository contains the Flutter project scaffold and code for Phase 1 (Planning) of the Clothes Helper application.  As part of Phase 1 we set up the project structure, define the main navigation flow and model classes, and prepare the services and providers needed for later phases.  

### Requirements

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) – please ensure you have the latest stable version installed on your machine.
- Dart 3.

### Project Structure

The project is organised into several top‑level directories:

- **lib/** – Contains Dart source code for the application including models, services, providers, screens and utility classes.
- **assets/** – Contains static assets such as images and fonts.
- **android/** and **ios/** – Placeholder directories generated by `flutter create` (these are empty in this scaffold; running `flutter create` will populate them).
- **pubspec.yaml** – Defines project dependencies, assets and fonts.

For a detailed breakdown of the source code structure see `lib/`.

## Development Notes

1. This repository does not include the generated Flutter project files (`android/`, `ios/`, `macos/`, `web/` etc.) because Flutter is not installed in this environment.  When you clone this repository locally, run:

   ```bash
   flutter create .
   flutter pub get
   ```

   This will populate the platform‑specific folders and fetch all dependencies defined in `pubspec.yaml`.

2. Phase 1 focuses on planning the architecture, defining model classes and setting up navigation.  Subsequent phases will implement functionality such as adding items, editing items, displaying ads, AI recommendations and cloud synchronisation.

3. Use the colour palette and fonts defined in `lib/utils/constants.dart` to maintain a consistent aesthetic throughout the app.  Both light and dark themes are supported.

4. A Git repository is initialised in this folder.  Feel free to commit your changes as you progress and push to a remote repository.
